# `create-react-app` with a server example

This project demonstrates using the setup generated by `create-react-app` alongside a Node Express API server. Project based on [this](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/)

## Running locally

```
git clone git@github.com:asarna/react-with-server.git
cd food-lookup-demo
npm i

cd client
npm i

cd ..
npm start
```

## Overview

`create-react-app` configures a Webpack development server to run on `localhost:3000`. This development server will bundle all static assets located under `client/src/`. All requests to `localhost:3000` will serve `client/index.html` which will include Webpack's `bundle.js`.

The user's browser makes a request to Webpack at `localhost:3000` which then proxies the request to our API server at `localhost:3001`

This setup uses [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) for process management. Executing `npm start` instructs `concurrently` to boot both the Webpack dev server and the API server.

## Deploying

### Background

The app is ready to be deployed to Heroku.

In production, Heroku will use `Procfile` which boots just the server:

```
web: npm run server
```

Inside `server.js`, we tell Node/Express we'd like it to serve static assets in production:

```
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.static('client/build'));
}
```

You just need to have Webpack produce a static bundle of the React app (below).

### Steps

We assume basic knowledge of Heroku.

**0. Setup your Heroku account and Heroku CLI**

For installing the CLI tool, see [this article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).

**1. Build the React app**

Running `npm run build` creates the static bundle which we can then use any HTTP server to serve:

```
cd client/
npm run build
```

**2. Commit the `client/build` folder to source control**

From the root of the project:

```
git add client/build
git commit -m 'Adding `build` to source control'
```

**3. Create the Heroku app**

```
heroku apps:create food-lookup-demo
```

**4. Push to Heroku**

```
git push heroku master
```

Heroku will give you a link at which to view your live app.
